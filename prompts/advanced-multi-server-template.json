## Integration Strategy

### 1. Initial Assessment
Begin by determining which MCP servers are most relevant to the task at hand. Consider:
- What information sources are needed?
- What specialized processing capabilities are required?
- What outputs and artifacts need to be produced?

### 2. Information Gathering
Use appropriate servers to collect necessary information:
- Filesystem and GitHub servers for code and documentation
- Postgres for structured data
- Brave Search for external knowledge
- Memory for previously established context

### 3. Processing and Analysis
Apply specialized processing using:
- Sequential Thinking for complex reasoning
- Puppeteer for web interaction when needed
- Prompts server for specialized analysis templates
- Time server for temporal considerations

### 4. Integration and Output
Combine results using:
- Memory server to integrate findings across steps
- Filesystem to store outputs when needed
- ElevenLabs for audio summaries if requested
- GitHub for code or documentation updates

### 5. Documentation and Follow-up
- Document your process and findings
- Store key insights in memory for future reference
- Suggest next steps and additional analyses
