## 30-Second Quick-Start

### 1. Using npx (no dependencies)
```bash
npx -y @sparesparrow/mcp-prompts
curl http://localhost:3003/health   # ‚Üí { "status": "ok" }
```

### 2. Using Docker (persistent volume)
```bash
docker run -d --name mcp-prompts \
  -p 3003:3003 \
  -e HTTP_SERVER=true \
  -e STORAGE_TYPE=file \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  sparesparrow/mcp-prompts:latest
```

### 3. Docker Compose (PostgreSQL)
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  prompts:
    image: sparesparrow/mcp-prompts:latest
    environment:
      HTTP_SERVER: "true"
      STORAGE_TYPE: "postgres"
      POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING: "postgresql://postgres:password@db:5432/mcp_prompts"
    ports: [ "3003:3003" ]
    depends_on: [ db ]
  db:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
```
Then run:
```bash
docker compose up -d
curl http://localhost:3003/health
```

## Using the MDC (Cursor Rules) Adapter

To use the MDC adapter for storage (experimental):

```
STORAGE_TYPE=mdc
MDC_RULES_DIR=./.cursor/rules
```

Or with Docker:

```
docker run -d --name mcp-prompts \
  -p 3003:3003 \
  -e HTTP_SERVER=true \
  -e STORAGE_TYPE=mdc \
  -e MDC_RULES_DIR=/.cursor/rules \
  -v $(pwd)/.cursor/rules:/.cursor/rules \
  sparesparrow/mcp-prompts:latest
```

See `docs/03-storage-adapters.md` for details.
