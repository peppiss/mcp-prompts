# Legacy README (temporary)

The original README (~1800 lines) is being broken into smaller, topic-focused documents under `docs/`.

If you need information that has not yet been migrated, view the previous version in the git history:

```bash
git show HEAD~1:README.md | less
```

Alternatively browse the file on GitHub:
<https://github.com/sparesparrow/mcp-prompts/blob/main/README.md>

Feel free to open an issue if something important is missing from the new docs.
