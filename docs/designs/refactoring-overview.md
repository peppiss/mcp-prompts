- ✅ Community and contribution sections
- ✅ One-click deployment buttons

### 2. **workspace-setup.mdc** 
**Phase 0: Foundational Setup**
- Initialize npm workspaces structure
- Create package directories and configurations
- Set up dependency linking
- Validate workspace functionality

### 3. **catalog-extraction.mdc**
**Phase 1: Prompt Catalog Separation**  
- Extract prompts into separate package
- Implement catalog management CLI
- Add validation and schema enforcement
- Create category-based organization

### 4. **contracts-creation.mdc**
**Phase 2: API Contracts & Testing**
- Create shared TypeScript interfaces
- Implement OpenAPI generation with tsoa
- Build golden test suite for cross-language compatibility
- Setup pre-commit hooks for spec synchronization

### 5. **pipeline-automation.mdc**
**Phase 3: CI/CD Automation**
- Multi-stage Dockerfile optimization
- GitHub Actions workflow enhancement
- Automated version management with changesets
- Multi-architecture Docker builds
- Quality gates and security scanning

### 6. **documentation-update.mdc**
**Phase 4: Final Documentation & Cleanup**
- Update README and create CONTRIBUTING.md
- Complete JSDoc documentation
- Package-specific documentation
- GitHub repository configuration
- Migration guides and cleanup

## How to Use These Files

### For Cursor AI Agent Execution

Each .mdc file is designed to be consumed by Cursor AI agents. To execute tasks from a specific category:

```bash
# In Cursor, reference the specific rule file
@workspace-setup.mdc proceed implementing and elaborating the TODOs and tasks

# Or for a different phase
@catalog-extraction.mdc implement the prompt catalog extraction tasks

# For specific subtasks
@contracts-creation.mdc focus on OpenAPI generation and tsoa setup
```

### Task Dependencies

The phases are designed to be executed in order, with some flexibility:

```
Phase 0 (workspace-setup) 
    ↓
Phase 1 (catalog-extraction) ← Can start before Phase 0 is complete
    ↓
Phase 2 (contracts-creation) ← Depends on Phase 0 completion
    ↓
Phase 3 (pipeline-automation) ← Depends on Phases 1 & 2
    ↓
Phase 4 (documentation-update) ← Can run in parallel with Phase 3
```

```

## Key Features of Each .mdc File

### Comprehensive Task Lists
- ✅ Each file contains detailed, actionable tasks
- ✅ Success criteria for validation
- ✅ Files to create/modify lists
- ✅ Testing requirements
- ✅ Reference documentation links

### Cursor-Optimized Format
- ✅ Proper YAML frontmatter with globs
- ✅ Clear descriptions for AI context
- ✅ Code examples and snippets
- ✅ Structured markdown for easy parsing

### Cross-Phase Coordination
- ✅ Tasks reference outputs from other phases
- ✅ Dependency management between packages
- ✅ Validation steps ensure integration works

## Benefits of This Organization

### 1. **Modular Execution**
- Each phase can be worked on independently
- AI agents can focus on specific domains
- Easy to pause and resume work

### 2. **Clear Ownership**
- Each .mdc file has a specific scope
- No overlapping responsibilities
- Clear success criteria for each phase

### 3. **Maintainable Process**
- Tasks are version-controlled with the code
- Easy to update and refine processes
- Documentation stays with implementation

### 4. **AI-Agent Friendly**
- Structured format for reliable parsing
- Context-rich descriptions
- Code examples for implementation guidance

## Usage Instructions for Developers

### Manual Execution
1. Read through the phase you want to work on
2. Follow the tasks in order
3. Check off completed items
4. Validate using success criteria

### AI-Agent Execution
1. Reference the specific .mdc file in Cursor
2. Ask the agent to implement specific tasks or entire phases
3. Review and validate the AI's work
4. Move to the next phase

### Hybrid Approach
1. Use AI agents for routine tasks (file creation, boilerplate)
2. Human review for architectural decisions
3. AI agents for testing and validation
4. Human oversight for final integration

## Estimated Timeline

| Phase | Estimated Time | Complexity |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| Phase 0 | 2-4 hours | Low |
| Phase 1 | 1-2 days | Medium |
| Phase 2 | 2-3 days | High |
| Phase 3 | 1-2 days | Medium |
| Phase 4 | 1 day | Low |

**Total: 6-12 days** depending on team size and AI agent usage.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Files are ready for immediate use
2. 🔄 Begin with `@workspace-setup.mdc` 
3. 🔄 Progress through phases sequentially
4. 🔄 Validate each phase before proceeding
5. 🔄 Use the improved README.md as the project face

This organization provides a clear, actionable path from the current monolithic structure to a modern, maintainable monorepo architecture that supports rapid development and cross-language implementations.
