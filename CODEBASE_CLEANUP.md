# Codebase Cleanup

This document explains the cleanup performed on the MCP Prompts codebase.

## Recent Cleanup (March 16, 2025)

The following cleanup tasks were performed:

1. **Enhanced Cleanup Script**
   - Updated `cleanup-temp-files.sh` to be more comprehensive
   - Added support for cleaning build artifacts, logs, and temporary files
   - Improved handling of legacy files

2. **Moved Temporary Configuration Files**
   - Moved `claude_desktop_config_stdio.json`, `mcp-config-stdio.json`, and `mcp-config.json` to `legacy/configs/`
   - These files are now ignored by git

3. **Removed Build Artifacts**
   - Cleaned up `dist/`, `build/`, and `output/` directories
   - Removed test results and coverage reports

4. **Updated .gitignore**
   - Fixed formatting issues in the .gitignore file
   - Added patterns for temporary configuration files
   - Added patterns for npm package files (*.tgz)
   - Added patterns for Docker temporary files

5. **Removed NPM Package Files**
   - Removed `sparesparrow-mcp-prompts-1.2.34.tgz` from the repository

## Changes Made

1. **Added TypeScript Support for SSE**
   - Created `src/sse.ts` to consolidate all SSE-related functionality
   - Provides type-safe implementations for SSE server and client
   - Includes bridge for MCP Inspector integration

2. **Improved Server Startup**
   - Created `src/scripts/start-server.ts` for TypeScript-based server startup
   - Properly loads environment variables from `.env` file
   - Provides clear logging of server configuration

3. **Added Testing Support**
   - Created `src/scripts/sse-test.ts` for testing SSE functionality
   - Can be run with `npm run test:sse`

4. **Updated HTTP Server**
   - Modified `src/http-server.ts` to use the new SSE implementation
   - Improved error handling and code organization

5. **Cleanup and Organization**
   - Created `legacy/` directory for old JavaScript and shell scripts
   - Added proper documentation for all new TypeScript files
   - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude temporary and legacy files
   - Removed redundant JavaScript files that have TypeScript replacements

## Removed Files

The following files have been removed as they are now replaced by TypeScript implementations:

- `scripts/validate-json.js` → replaced by `src/scripts/validate-json.ts`
- `run-local-server.js` → replaced by `src/scripts/start-server.ts`

## Script Migration Status

| Original Script | Status | TypeScript Replacement |
|-----------------|--------|------------------------|
| `validate-json.js` | ✅ Migrated | `src/scripts/validate-json.ts` |
| `run-local-server.js` | ✅ Migrated | `src/scripts/start-server.ts` |
| `fix-prompt-json.js` | ⏳ Pending | Not created yet |
| `fix-esm.js` | ⏳ Pending | Not created yet |
| Shell scripts | ⏳ Pending | Will be migrated as needed |

## New npm Scripts

The following npm scripts have been added:

- `npm run start` - Start the server using the TypeScript implementation
- `npm run test:sse` - Test the SSE functionality
- `npm run validate:json` - Validate JSON files using TypeScript implementation

## Type Definitions

Added the following TypeScript type definitions:

- `@types/express`
- `@types/cors`
- `@types/ws`
- `@types/eventsource`

## Legacy Files

The following files have been moved to the `legacy/` directory:

- SSE-related JavaScript files: `mcp-inspector-sse-client.js`, `mcp-inspector-sse-patch.js`, etc.
- Shell scripts: `run-custom-server.sh`, `run-with-env.sh`, `start-mcp-server.sh`

These files are kept for reference but should not be used in production.

## Files Pending Cleanup

The following files need further assessment for cleanup or migration:

### Root Directory
| File | Status | Recommendation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| `run-local-server.js` | ✅ Removed | Replaced by `npm run start` using `src/scripts/start-server.ts` |
| `create-workflow.sh` | ⏳ Pending | Keep if still in use for workflow management |
| `jest.config.js` | ✅ Keep | Required for Jest testing configuration |
| `cleanup-temp-files.sh` | ✅ Keep | Used for cleaning temporary files |

### Scripts Directory
| File | Status | Recommendation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| `scripts/build/ensure-config.js` | ⏳ Pending | Evaluate for migration to TypeScript |
| `scripts/build/fix-build.js` | ⏳ Pending | Evaluate for migration to TypeScript |
| `scripts/fix-esm.js` | ⏳ Pending | Plan for TypeScript migration |
| `scripts/fix-prompt-json.js` | ⏳ Pending | Plan for TypeScript migration |
| `scripts/build-and-push-docker.sh` | ✅ Keep | Used for Docker build process |
| `scripts/docker-manage.sh` | ✅ Keep | Used for Docker management |
| `scripts/fix_workflows.sh` | ⏳ Pending | Evaluate if still needed |
| `scripts/publish.sh` | ✅ Keep | Used for publishing |
| `scripts/release.sh` | ✅ Keep | Used for release management |
| `scripts/run-docker-tests.sh` | ✅ Keep | Used for running tests in Docker |
| `scripts/run-tests.sh` | ✅ Keep | Used for running tests |
| `scripts/setup-claude-desktop.sh` | ⏳ Pending | Evaluate if still needed |

### Custom-MCP Directory
| File | Status | Recommendation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| `custom-mcp/custom-server.js` | ⏳ Pending | Evaluate if superseded by TypeScript server, if so, move to legacy |

### Build Directory
Content in the `build` directory is generated from TypeScript compilation and should not be modified directly.

## How to Use

1. **Starting the Server**
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

2. **Testing SSE**
   ```bash
   npm run test:sse
   ```

3. **Cleaning Up Temporary Files**
   ```bash
   ./cleanup-temp-files.sh
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Add unit tests for the SSE implementation**
2. **Migrate remaining JavaScript scripts to TypeScript**
   - Focus on `scripts/fix-prompt-json.js` and `scripts/fix-esm.js` first
   - Then evaluate build scripts 
3. **Clean up root directory**
   - ✅ Removed `run-local-server.js` as it's been replaced by TypeScript implementation
4. **Improve documentation with JSDoc comments**
5. **Consider adding a proper logging system**
6. **Remove redundant files as TypeScript replacements are created**
7. **Consider using a script bundler like esbuild for better script distribution**
