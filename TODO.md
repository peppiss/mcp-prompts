Analysis and Updated TODO for mcp-prompts1. Project Analysis SummaryProject GoalThe project aims to create a versatile and extensible "Prompt-as-a-Service" platform. Its core purpose is to manage, store, and execute prompts and complex workflows. The architecture is designed with flexibility in mind, supporting multiple storage backends (Memory, File, Postgres), a templating engine, a workflow engine for complex sequences, and an HTTP API for integration. Future goals include native integration with Android applications.Codebase StateThe project is in an early but well-structured development phase. The foundation is solid, with a clear separation of concerns:Server: An express server provides the main API endpoints.Storage: An IStorageAdapter interface defines a clear contract for data persistence, with three initial implementations.Services: Services for prompts (PromptService), workflows (WorkflowService), and sequences (SequenceService) encapsulate the core business logic.Configuration: A typed configuration system is in place.Tooling: The project uses TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Jest for a modern development experience.However, many of the features outlined in the GitHub issues and the roadmap are still placeholders or are yet to be implemented. The current state represents a functional "skeleton" waiting for the core logic to be fleshed out.2. GitHub Issues: Status and Action PlanBased on the codebase review, none of the tracked issues are currently resolved. The resolution steps provided in the original TODO.md are accurate and form a clear implementation plan.Issue #30: Implement full CRUD operations for promptsStatus: Open. The IStorageAdapter interface and its implementations (Memory, File, Postgres) are missing update and delete methods. The HTTP server also lacks the corresponding PUT and DELETE endpoints.Action: The proposed resolution steps are correct and necessary. This is a critical feature for core functionality.Issue #29: Add more advanced validation and transformation logicStatus: Open. The Zod schemas in src/schemas.ts are basic and only validate types. They lack refined rules like minimum length, default values, or transformations.Action: Implementing the suggested validation enhancements (.min(), .nonempty(), .transform()) will greatly improve data integrity and robustness.Issue #28: Enhance with more template helper functionsStatus: Open. The PromptService currently has hardcoded template helpers. It lacks a flexible, extensible mechanism for adding new helpers.Action: The plan to create a templateHelpers map and pass it to the Handlebars rendering context is the correct approach to make the templating engine more powerful.Issues #27 & #26: Add more sequence and workflow logicStatus: Open. The WorkflowService and SequenceService can only execute steps in a linear fashion. There is no support for conditional logic, branching, or parallel execution.Action: This is a major feature enhancement. It requires modifying the IWorkflowStep interface and significantly refactoring the service logic to support a dynamic execution flow.Issue #25: Add a more robust health checkStatus: Open. The /health endpoint is static and does not provide a true indication of the service's health, as it doesn't check its dependencies (e.g., the database connection).Action: Implementing a healthCheck method in the storage adapters and calling it from the health endpoint is the standard and correct way to resolve this.Issue #24: Implement Eleven Labs API integrationStatus: Open. The ElevenLabsService exists but contains only placeholder code. It does not connect to the Eleven Labs API.Action: Completing this service requires implementing the API client logic, managing API keys via configuration, and creating an endpoint to expose the functionality.3. Updated and Consolidated TODO RoadmapThis roadmap integrates the tasks from the GitHub issues into the phased development plan.Phase 1: Core Functionality & API Stabilization[ ] Implement Full CRUD Operations (Issue #30):[ ] Add update and delete methods to the IStorageAdapter interface in src/interfaces.ts.[ ] Implement update and delete in MemoryStorageAdapter, FileStorageAdapter, and PostgresStorageAdapter.[ ] Add PUT /prompts/:id and DELETE /prompts/:id endpoints to src/http-server.ts.[ ] Write integration tests for the new update and delete functionalities.[ ] Strengthen Input Validation (Issue #29):[ ] Enhance promptSchema and workflowSchema in src/schemas.ts with rules like .min(), .default(), and .transform().[ ] Use safeParse in API endpoints to handle validation errors gracefully.[ ] Add Robust Health Check (Issue #25):[ ] Add a healthCheck(): Promise<boolean> method to the IStorageAdapter interface.[ ] Implement the healthCheck method in each adapter to verify dependency status (e.g., database connection).[ ] Update the /health endpoint to use the adapter's health check and return a 503 status on failure.[ ] Refine Error Handling:[ ] Create a centralized error handling middleware in http-server.ts to ensure consistent and structured error responses (e.g., { "error": "message" }).[ ] BUG: The PostgresStorageAdapter has an intermittent connection issue under heavy load.[ ] Investigate pg connection pooling configuration.[ ] Implement retry logic for transient connection errors.Phase 2: Workflow & Service Integration[ ] Expand Workflow Engine Logic (Issues #26, #27):[ ] Update IWorkflowStep in src/interfaces.ts with optional condition, onSuccess, onFailure, and type: 'parallel' properties.[ ] Refactor WorkflowService to evaluate conditions and support branching.[ ] Implement parallel step execution using Promise.all.[ ] Enhance Template Engine (Issue #28):[ ] Create a templateHelpers map in prompt-service.ts.[ ] Update the render function to dynamically register helpers from the map.[ ] Add unit tests for new helpers.[ ] Implement Eleven Labs API Integration (Issue #24):[ ] Add Eleven Labs configuration (API key) to src/config.ts.[ ] Implement the generateAudio method in src/elevenlabs-service.ts to call the TTS API.[ ] Create a POST /audio/generate endpoint to expose the functionality.[ ] Implement State Management for Workflows:[ ] Design a system to store the state of running workflows, allowing them to be paused, resumed, and inspected. This likely involves extending the storage adapters.[ ] Develop Workflow CLI:[ ] Improve src/scripts/workflow-cli.ts to support creating, testing, and debugging workflows interactively.[x] Create Workflow Templates:[x] Develop a library of pre-built workflow templates for common use cases.Phase 3: Android & Native Integration[ ] Define Native Service API (Rust): Finalize function signatures and data structures in android_app/android/mcp_native_service/src/lib.rs.[ ] Implement JNI Bindings: Complete the JNI bindings in MainActivity.kt and McpService.kt to call Rust functions.[ ] Secure Data Transfer: Implement secure methods for passing sensitive data between the Android app and the native service.[ ] Build and Test Android App: Create a simple UI in the Android app to test fetching prompts via the native service.Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance[ ] Increase Unit Test Coverage: Write more unit tests for prompt-service.ts, workflow-service.ts, etc.[ ] Write End-to-End Integration Tests: Create tests that simulate a full user flow (API -> Android App).[ ] Automate docker-compose Testing: Expand run-docker-tests.sh to test various multi-container configurations automatically.[ ] Performance Testing: Develop benchmarks for API response times and workflow execution speed.Phase 5: Documentation & Developer Experience[x] Generate API Reference from Code: Use TypeDoc to generate API reference from JSDoc comments.[x] Create a Comprehensive User Guide: Write a step-by-step guide for new users.[x] Document Android Integration: Create a guide for mobile developers.[x] Refine CONTRIBUTING.md: Update the guide with clear instructions.Phase 6: Deployment & Finalization[x] Finalize NPM Package: Ensure package.json is correctly configured for publishing.[x] Streamline Docker Hub Publication: Refine the build-and-publish.sh script and GitHub Actions.[x] Update CHANGELOG and Release: Prepare for a v1.0.0 release.[x] Add Helm Charts: Create Helm charts for simplified Kubernetes deployment.
