# Analysis and Updated TODO for mcp-prompts

---

## 1. Project Analysis Summary

### Project Goal

The project aims to create a versatile and extensible **Prompt-as-a-Service** platform. Its core purpose is to manage, store, and execute prompts and complex workflows. The architecture is designed with flexibility in mind, supporting:

- Multiple storage backends (Memory, File, Postgres)
- A templating engine
- A workflow engine for complex sequences
- An HTTP API for integration

Future goals include native integration with Android applications.

### Codebase State

The project is in an early but well-structured development phase. The foundation is solid, with a clear separation of concerns:

- **Server:** An Express server provides the main API endpoints.
- **Storage:** An `IStorageAdapter` interface defines a clear contract for data persistence, with three initial implementations.
- **Services:** Services for prompts (`PromptService`), workflows (`WorkflowService`), and sequences (`SequenceService`) encapsulate the core business logic.
- **Configuration:** A typed configuration system is in place.
- **Tooling:** The project uses TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Jest for a modern development experience.

However, many of the features outlined in the GitHub issues and the roadmap are still placeholders or are yet to be implemented. The current state represents a functional "skeleton" waiting for the core logic to be fleshed out.

## 2. GitHub Issues: Status and Action Plan

Based on the codebase review, none of the tracked issues are currently resolved. The resolution steps provided in the original TODO.md are accurate and form a clear implementation plan.

- **Issue #30: Implement full CRUD operations for prompts**
  - **Status:** Open. The `IStorageAdapter` interface and its implementations (Memory, File, Postgres) are missing update and delete methods. The HTTP server also lacks the corresponding PUT and DELETE endpoints.
  - **Action:** The proposed resolution steps are correct and necessary. This is a critical feature for core functionality.

- **Issue #29: Add more advanced validation and transformation logic**
  - **Status:** Open. The Zod schemas in `src/schemas.ts` are basic and only validate types. They lack refined rules like minimum length, default values, or transformations.
  - **Action:** Implementing the suggested validation enhancements (`.min()`, `.nonempty()`, `.transform()`) will greatly improve data integrity and robustness.

- **Issue #28: Enhance with more template helper functions**
  - **Status:** Open. The `PromptService` currently has hardcoded template helpers. It lacks a flexible, extensible mechanism for adding new helpers.
  - **Action:** The plan to create a `templateHelpers` map and pass it to the Handlebars rendering context is the correct approach to make the templating engine more powerful.

- **Issues #27 & #26: Add more sequence and workflow logic**
  - **Status:** Open. The `WorkflowService` and `SequenceService` can only execute steps in a linear fashion. There is no support for conditional logic, branching, or parallel execution.
  - **Action:** This is a major feature enhancement. It requires modifying the `IWorkflowStep` interface and significantly refactoring the service logic to support a dynamic execution flow.

- **Issue #25: Add a more robust health check**
  - **Status:** Open. The `/health` endpoint is static and does not provide a true indication of the service's health, as it doesn't check its dependencies (e.g., the database connection).
  - **Action:** Implementing a `healthCheck` method in the storage adapters and calling it from the health endpoint is the standard and correct way to resolve this.

- **Issue #24: Implement Eleven Labs API integration**
  - **Status:** Open. The `ElevenLabsService` exists but contains only placeholder code. It does not connect to the Eleven Labs API.
  - **Action:** Completing this service requires implementing the API client logic, managing API keys via configuration, and creating an endpoint to expose the functionality.

## 3. Updated and Consolidated TODO Roadmap

This roadmap integrates the tasks from the GitHub issues into the phased development plan.

---

# Formalized Developmental Trajectory for the mcp-prompts System

It is assumed that the foundational components and principal functionalities of the system have been established. The following roadmap outlines a strategic progression to elevate the project to production-readiness and enterprise-grade utility, with emphasis on scalability, security, and developer experience. Each objective includes rationale and detailed implementation directives.

---

## **Phase I: Fortification of the Core API & Storage Scalability**

**Goal:** Ensure the system can reliably manage enterprise-level workloads. Completion of this phase is a prerequisite for further advancements.

- [ ] **Bulk Data Manipulation Operations**
  - **Objective:** Add endpoints for bulk actions (e.g., `POST /api/prompts/bulk`, `DELETE /api/prompts/bulk`) to improve efficiency for advanced users and integrations.
  - **Details:** 
    - Accept a JSON array of prompt objects for simultaneous creation or modification.
    - Operations should be transactional (especially in `PostgresStorageAdapter`) to guarantee atomicity.
    - Responses must report partial successes/failures with detailed diagnostics.

- [ ] **Data Set Control Mechanisms**
  - **Objective:** Enhance all GET endpoints returning collections (e.g., `/api/prompts`, `/api/workflows`) with:
    - Pagination (`?page=1&limit=20`)
    - Sorting (`?sortBy=createdAt:desc`)
    - Robust filtering (`?filter=...`, `?tags=internal,qa`, `?isTemplate=true`)
  - **Details:** 
    - Filtering should support queries against specific fields.
    - Database queries must be optimized with indexes on filterable/sortable columns to prevent performance degradation.

- [ ] **Rectification of Postgres Connection Instability**
  - **Objective:** Resolve connection instability in `PostgresStorageAdapter` under high load.
  - **Details:** 
    - Implement and validate a robust connection pool manager (e.g., `pg-pool`).
    - Carefully configure `max`, `idleTimeoutMillis`, and `connectionTimeoutMillis`.
    - Expose pool metrics (active, idle, pending connections) for observability.

- [ ] **Introduction of a Caching Layer**
  - **Objective:** Implement intelligent caching (e.g., Redis) to reduce DB load and improve API latency.
  - **Details:** 
    - Use the "Cache-Aside" pattern: check Redis first, fall back to DB, then cache result.
    - Employ LRU eviction policy.
    - Devise a cache invalidation strategy for updates/deletes to prevent stale data.

---

## **Phase II: Advancement of the Workflow & Real-time Processing Engine**

**Goal:** Transform the workflow engine into a dynamic, stateful, and resilient orchestration platform.

- [ ] **Workflow State Persistence**
  - **Objective:** Enable `WorkflowService` to save workflow state/context to storage.
  - **Details:** 
    - Modify DB schema: add `workflow_instances` table with `instance_id`, `workflow_id`, `version`, `status` (`running`, `paused`, etc.), `current_step_id`, and a JSONB `context` field.
    - Enables pausing, resuming, and surviving restarts; foundational for auditing and analytics.

- [ ] **"Human-in-the-Loop" Step Modality**
  - **Objective:** Add a workflow step type (e.g., `type: 'human-approval'`) that suspends execution pending external input.
  - **Details:** 
    - Expose a secure endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/workflows/{instanceId}/resume`) for resuming.
    - Implement a timeout mechanism for such steps to allow alternate paths or failure if no input is received.

- [ ] **Real-time Progress Streaming**
  - **Objective:** Leverage Server-Sent Events (SSE) to broadcast granular workflow progress.
  - **Details:** 
    - Push structured events: `step_started`, `step_completed`, `step_failed`, `workflow_completed`.
    - Payloads should include `stepId`, `instanceId`, output, etc.
    - Include heartbeat mechanism to close stale connections.

- [ ] **Workflow Versioning**
  - **Objective:** Implement workflow versioning for non-disruptive updates.
  - **Details:** 
    - Modifying a workflow creates a new, incrementally versioned entity.
    - Existing instances continue with their original version; new instances use the latest (unless specified).
    - Enables stability, auditability, and A/B testing.

---

## **Phase III: Enhancement of Security & Observability**

**Goal:** Harden the application for secure, auditable, and transparent production deployment.

- [ ] **API Authentication & Authorization**
  - **Objective:** Secure all endpoints using stateless, token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
  - **Details:** 
    - Create authentication endpoints to issue JWTs.
    - Middleware to validate tokens and attach user identity/roles.
    - Enable role-based access control (RBAC) for sensitive endpoints.

- [ ] **Structured Logging**
  - **Objective:** Replace `console.log` with a structured logging library (e.g., pino, winston).
  - **Details:** 
    - Output logs in JSON format with `traceId`, timestamp, log level, and contextual data (`workflowId`, `userId`).
    - Facilitates powerful querying and request tracing.

- [ ] **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**
  - **Objective:** Integrate security scans into CI/CD (GitHub Actions).
  - **Details:** 
    - Run `npm audit` for dependency vulnerabilities.
    - Integrate SAST tools (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot) for code analysis and remediation guidance.

- [ ] **API Rate Limiting**
  - **Objective:** Apply rate limiting to all API endpoints (e.g., via `express-rate-limit`).
  - **Details:** 
    - Default: 100 requests/minute per IP; return HTTP 429 with `Retry-After` header.
    - Apply stricter limits to expensive endpoints as needed.
