# MCP Prompts Monorepo Packages

This directory contains the modular packages for the MCP Prompts Server monorepo:

- **mcp-prompts-catalog**: A curated collection of prompts and templates for the MCP ecosystem. Distributable as an npm package.
- **mcp-prompts-contracts**: Shared TypeScript types and OpenAPI specifications for API contracts and cross-package compatibility.

Each package is independently versioned and published, enabling scalable development and clear separation of concerns.
